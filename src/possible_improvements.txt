Code quality:
->  F | documentations, docstrings, etc.

Extensions:
-> implementing methods from Thon's PhD?
    - generating discrete-valued OOM operator matrices
    - invalidity adjustment
    - caching and other great things in m7thon/tom
-> different algorithms for learning continuous-valued OOMs (unexplored)
