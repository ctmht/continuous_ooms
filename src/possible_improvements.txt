-> DONE: make Observable objects unique
-> DONE: rephrase c/i word finding from k = 2 to k = 2L+1 instead of k = 0 to k = 2L-1

    Code quality:
->  F | documentations, docstrings, etc.
-> ALMOST: refactor creation and learning algorithms for easy choice when creating an OOM (see: Extensions)
-> ALMOST: warnings and errors
-> DONE: normalize code between representations of Observables and ObsSequences etc.
-> DONE: AF | delete all data that is not being used (and simplify most return values)
-> NO: proper logging control from most levels...?

    Theoretical robustness:
-> DONE: verify that from_sparse is theoretically justified and not just that it works

    Reproducibility and replicability:
-> DONE: folder of experiments
    - each experiment completely handles exceptions...
    - very well documented
-> DONE: AF | fix seed on final runs if possible...

    Extensions:
-> NO: implement methods from Thon's PhD?
       - generating discrete-valued OOM operator matrices
       - invalidity adjustment
-> NO: different algorithms for learning continuous-valued OOMs
