-> DONE: make Observable objects unique
-> DONE: rephrase c/i word finding from k = 2 to k = 2L+1 instead of k = 0 to k = 2L-1

    Code quality:
-> proper logging control from most levels...?
-> normalize code between representations of Observables and ObsSequences etc.
-> refactor creation and learning algorithms for easy choice when creating an OOM (see: Extensions)
-> warnings and errors
-> AF | delete all data that is not being used (and simplify most return values)
->  F | documentations, docstrings, etc.

    Theoretical robustness:
-> verify that from_sparse is theoretically justified and not just that it works

    Reproducibility and replicability:
-> folder of experiments
    - each experiment completely handles exceptions...
    - very well documented
-> AF | fix seed on final runs if possible...

    Extensions:
-> implement methods from Thon's PhD?
    - generating discrete-valued OOM operator matrices
    - invalidity adjustment
-> different algorithms for learning continuous-valued OOMs
