# Continuous-Valued Observable Operator Models

This project provides an implementation of Observable Operator Models (OOMs) and an updated learning algorithm for both
discrete-valued and continuous-valued processes. Its implementation is part of my AI Bachelor Project at the
University of Groningen (ongoing).
